# **🧮 calc.cmd: The "Intellectual" Calculator**
> *"Why get the answer instantly when you can wait for 'AI' to think about it?"*

**calc.cmd** is the latest addition to the Nightmare Ecosystem. It is a calculator that prioritizes project cross-promotion and artificial latency over actual mathematical utility.

## **🚀 Features**
* **The "AI" Processing Tax**: Every calculation is processed using "the most intelligent AI available" (which is actually a 100-cycle spinner loop using `ping` delays). 
* **Aggressive Adware**: Before you can even enter a number, you must survive a mandatory ASCII billboard for **notepad--.cmd**. 
* **Forced Downloader**: If you agree to the advertisement, the script uses `curl` to automatically infect your directory with the **notepad--.cmd** source code. 
* **"Hello World" Fallback**: If you enter an invalid calculation or the script experiences a logic stroke, it refuses to explain the error and simply prints "Hello World!" instead. 

## **🕹️ Usage**
1. **Navigate the Ad**: Choose whether to download the next layer of the nightmare.
2. **Enter Calculation**: Input your math (e.g., `5 + 5`).
3. **The Meditation**: Watch the "AI" spinner rotate while your CPU spawns 100+ instances of `ping.exe`.
4. **The Result**: Receive your answer, assuming the `%RANDOM%` gods and your syntax are in alignment.

## **🛠️ Internal Logic**
* **Variable `%d%`**: Stores your raw mathematical input.
* **Variable `%dd%`**: Stores the evaluated result using `set /a`.
* **Error Handling**: Uses `%errorlevel%` checks to decide between providing a result or a sarcastic "Hello World!".
